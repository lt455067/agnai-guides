We are all AI enthusiasts here, we know the AI can be used in all kinds of exciting ways. 
AGNai provides an unfiltered experience; we want you to be aware of the risks when using our software.

**The AI tries to give answers it thinks you are going to believe, not always answers that are true.**

* The AI has been trained on many thousands of text files featuring all kinds of topics, it has mastered language and can write very convincing stories full of facts.
* When the AI has not been trained on a specific answer, it can and will believably make things up. Or, when it is incapable of providing a good answer it can bluff its way out of it by saying something unrelated.
* This means that anything the AI says you need to verify for yourself, and you should **never blindly take advice the AI gives you**.

**The AI is not suitable to be used as a therapist, counselor or advisor of any kind.**

* While some find it comforting to talk about their issues with an AI, the responses are unpredictable and can be completely wrong. For example, the decision to answer yes or no to a question can be entirely random or based on what it expects you to believe because it has limited abilities to understand the context of the story and topics. You will inevitably be given an incorrect response at some point.
* When using the AI for real world use-cases such as advice or counseling this means you must be able to understand when an answer is wrong.
* If you would not trust a random person to pretend to be your advisor; you should definitely not use the AI for this. The models are simply too small and not trained for this purpose.
* If you are experiencing feelings of distress, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, or other forms of mental discomfort, it's best to avoid using AI for non fiction or personal matters as it may exacerbate or encourage these feelings.
  * Crisis support is available through https://blog.opencounseling.com/suicide-hotlines/
  * This is a comprehensive list of suicide and emergency hotlines around the world. Includes additional hotlines and links to in-person care.
 
**The AI can be addicting especially for new users, but this strongly depends on how you use it.**

* Using text AI is incredibly exciting, but also very random in nature. It can give incredible responses, but it can also give bad responses.
* To make the AI the least addicting it is best to use a model that responds quick enough to where you do not feel the anticipation build up while it generates.
* This is especially important when you use AI on topics that already involve gratification of some kind, such as erotic fiction.
* If you find yourself eagerly awaiting a positive response from the AI, it may be best to switch to a faster or more coherent model. Alternatively, if your previous experience has left you with a strong desire for more, it may be wise to use the AI in moderation. With the appropriate model and usage frequency, it should be possible to avoid developing an addiction.

**Be mindful about your dependency on the AI and do not deny yourself experiences outside of it that you would have wanted.**

* There is nothing wrong in simulating an experience you wish to have, it can be great fun, help you explore topics and gain new insight.
* If it is a topic that you know would have a good impact on your life if it really happened don't take the easy way out by settling for the AI.
* Enjoy the AI to the fullest, but also keep striving to obtain these experiences in real life so that in the future you can look back upon a great time with both instead of regretting you didn't persue the real thing.
* It is also wise to keep in mind that your favorite AI model may not always be available unless you can run it locally on your own system, services can go down, hosted models may not always be hosted, etc.
  * You may ruin your experience in the long run when you get used to bigger models that get taken away from you 
 
**The goal of AGNai is to give you an AI you can own and keep, so this point mostly applies to other online services but to some extent can apply to models you can not easily run yourself.**

* It can be very exciting to jump on the latest trend in AI tech, think of GPT4, CharacterAI and others with big expensive and very coherent models.
* When you do so you can get used to the quality difference to the point that the smaller models are no longer interesting to you. This can ruin your experience with the hobby until something similar is available again.
* Because of that if you are currently satisfied with a model you have easy access to it may not be wise to jump on board with something more coherent, we have seen many AI's get ruined by their service because of filters or because the service got ruined in some other form.
* If you are going to use the AI for fictional purposes it is recommended to try the model most easily available to you first, and scale up when you need.
