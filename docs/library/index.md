# Library

The Library is the place where you can set up your own [memory books](https://agnai.guide/docs/memory/memory-books), upload [embeddings](https://agnai.guide/docs/memory/embeddings), create your own, customized [prompt template type](https://agnai.guide/docs/chat-settings/prompt-templates) or, finally, your own [scenarios](https://agnai.guide/docs/library/scenarios) with customized events.

Note that you do not need to use the Library to have a good experience on Agnai, but it provides you with extra customizability should you wish for it.
