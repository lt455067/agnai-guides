| Advanced Settings                     | Could refer to the "Advanced" section of a character card, or the "Advanced" section in the preset of a chat.  In the context of a character card, advanced settings let you override the system prompt, post-conversation history instruction, and other advanced features of the character. In the context of a tab in the preset for a chat, allows you to control a number of parameters that are sent to the LLM / Inference Engine / API of your choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Character Book                        | A memory book, specific to the character.  Can contain things this character has experienced.  Used across chats.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Character Cards                       | The greeting, persona, persona schema, example dialog, picture, name, lore book (character book), and other information about a specific character.  Character cards can be found around the internet on websitesl like chub, on reddit boards, and in discord servers.  Often times, character cards are shared by embedding information within images and so if someone shares their character with you by sending you an image, it's likely that image itself is the character card.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Character System Prompt               | The system prompt is the initial instruction sent to the language model as part of the prompt template.  Often times, the system prompt is something like "Respond with the next message in a fictional role-play between {{char}} and {{user}}."  Overriding this system prompt allows you to make more advanced character cards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Chat Embeddings                       | A chat embedding is a previous chat message that has been "indexed" in a special "embeddings" database.  When you load a chat in Agnaistic, the messages that load on the screen get embedded in a database within your browser.  This database then allows Agnaistic to look up "similar" or "relevant" chat messages and add them (aka embed them) into your prompt.  This semantic retrieval enables a sort of "long term memory" without wasting context and confusing the model with irrelevant chat messages.  This is a great way to have messages from longer chats "remembered" by the character.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Chat History                          | The previous messages you've sent to the character in the chat.

| Context                               | The tokens added to your prompt to the model.  Think of this as information relevant to the current situation.  This includes everything -- the character description, the scene, previous chat messages, memory, etc.  Anything that is not within the context of the current prompt is simply not considered by the LLM when generating the response.  Responses are generated entirely based on the context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Context Limit                         | Due to limitations inherent in the underlying technology that powers language models, context is limited for a number of reasons.  Some models are trained on specific context sizes and do not understand numbers outside that range.  Other models have a dynamic context limit but as the context size increases the performance of the model (it's ability to generate coherent replies and to access data within the context) is decreased.  Most concerning is that higher context sizes require more physical hardware to process and thus ultimately cost more to use.  This is why 4k models can be free but 8k models require a subscription.  The larger the language model, the higher the cost of additional context -- this is why the 70b model currently has a context limit of 6k.  Context limits take into account not only your chat history, but also memory, prompt template, system prompt, character card, and also the new response tokens -- the higher you set your max new tokens, the less context you'll have available for memory.  This can cause problems with larger character cards (i.e. > 500 tokens) on the free models where you only have 4000 tokens of context available. |
| Eta                                   | Eta (η) in regards to Mirostat acts as the learning rate for the algorithm. It determines how quickly Mirostat adapts the parameters (for example, "k" in top-k) decoding based on the current perplexity and the target value. A higher learning rate leads to faster adjustments but might be more prone to fluctuations, while a lower rate makes for smoother adaptation but potentially slower convergence towards the target perplexity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Example Chats / Example Dialog        | The example chats, aka example dialog, provide guidance as to how the bot should respond.  These are a strong indicator for chat styles and can be very helpful in getting specific types of responses.  Going too heavy here will eat up your token count, however, and could reduce overall creativity.  Putting these like: <br><br>{{user}}: I say blah blah blah<br>{{char}}: Oh, I love it when you say blah blah blah!<br><br> will let you group user messages with character responses.  Separate distinct topics in example dialog with a blank line.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| LLM / Models                          | Large Language Model (LLM), or simply "Model", is the mathamatical tool used to generate text.  Different models have different technical structures, use different numbers (aka weights), and interpret your prompt differently resulting in variations in the output generation.  LLMs work on tokens and their output can be adjusted by altering the probability of the tokens via advanced settings (for example, temperature).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Memory Book                           | A set of manually added memory entries.  Each memory entry has a set of keywords that the memory triggers on.  Unlike chat embeds and user embeds, memory entries are only added to the prompt when their keywords are triggered.  It's best to keep memory entries short so that you can fit more memories in a smaller amount of context.  Since memories are retrieved by keyword, keeping relevant details behind separate keywords allows you to maximize the value gain from the dynamic nature of these entries.  Memories are given names, as are the memory books, and memories can be toggled on and off.  A disabled memory is not included into the prompt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Memory Context Limit                  | The number of tokens in context to use for adding entries from the memory book or character book.  The memory context limit will be filled with the highest priority memory entries and those entries will be ordered by their weight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Mirostat                              | Mirostat is an algorithm for text generation that aims to create high-quality text by directly controlling its "surprisingness" or "interestingness." This is measured by a metric called perplexity, which basically reflects how unexpected a sequence of words is.  Mirostat adjusts several "creativity knobs" depending on the implementation, including Top K and possibly others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Tau                                   | Tau (τ) in Mirostat serves as the target perplexity level. It essentially defines the desired level of "surprisingness" or "interestingness" you want the generated text to have. Mirostat dynamically adjusts the text generation process to bring the actual perplexity as close to this target value as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
